// Firefox's scrollbar coloring cascades throughout which is why it's set at the html level
// However, the width sizing is not, but this has been added to the wuiScrollBar mixin as well

html {
  // sass-lint:disable-block no-misspelled-properties
  scrollbar-width: thin;
  scrollbar-color: transparentize($wuiColorDarkShade, .5) transparent; // Firefox support
}
